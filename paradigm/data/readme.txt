# README
All recording sessions with Patrick Kahr are stored here.
Every session should be stored in a folder with the following name convention: "YYYY_MM_DD"
Every block that is recorded within a session should be stored as block_Z.xdf, with Z being an increasing integer for each block that was recorded (starting with 1)
In every folder should be the .xdf file(s) as well as a paradigm.txt file in which the paradigm is explained.
